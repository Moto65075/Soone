[00:19.67]Todos os dias quando acordo
[00:26.54]Não tenho mais

[00:30.80]Mas tenho muito tempo
[00:34.83]Temos todo o tempo do mundo
[00:41.01]Todos os dias
[00:44.15]Antes de dormir
[00:46.43]Lembro e esqueço
[00:48.19]Como foi o dia
[00:51.23]Sempre em frente
[00:55.53]Não temos tempo a perder

[01:08.13]Que esse sangue amargo
[01:11.71]E tão sério
[01:16.66]E selvagem! Selvagem!
[01:27.34]Selvagem!

[01:53.32]É da cor dos teus olhos
[01:57.03]Castanhos
[02:03.21]Então me abraça forte
[02:08.52]E diz mais uma vez
[02:10.99]Que já estamos

[02:19.92]Temos nosso próprio tempo
[02:24.49]Temos nosso próprio tempo
[02:29.44]Temos nosso próprio tempo

[00:11.98]It's fine, it's cool
[00:15.70]You can say that we are nothing, but you know the truth
[00:19.68]And guess I'm the fool
[00:23.40]With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof
[00:28.18]I don't wanna call it off
[00:30.84]But you don't wanna call it love
[00:32.96]You only wanna be the one that I call "baby"

[00:48.92]Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
[00:52.90]Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)
[00:56.89]You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
[01:01.14]Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)
[01:05.39]You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
[01:09.64]I'm cliché, who cares?
[01:13.35]It's a sexually explicit kind of love affair
[01:17.61]And I cry, it's not fair
[01:21.86]I just need a little lovin', I just need a little air
[01:27.17]Think I'm gonna call it off

[02:02.76]You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
[02:15.78]When you wake up next to him in the middle of the night
[02:19.50]With your head in your hands, you're nothing more than his wife
[02:23.50]And when you think about me, all of those years ago
[02:27.48]You're standing face to face with "I told you so"
[02:31.73]You know I hate to say, "I told you so"
[02:35.71]You know I hate to say, but, I told you so
[02:41.03]You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
